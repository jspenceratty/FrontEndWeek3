                        chair' set up for
                        me next to him in the office. He put a kitty warming pad on it so I stay nice and warm.

                        Dad calls these treats. They are a puree of some sort--they come from a metallic-looking pouch.
                        I typically get to enjoy my licksies after I have
                        gone out in the garage to look at the stuff out there. Sometimes I even encounter things like
                        mice and snakes out there.  There's a whole world to explore out there.

                    <td>
                        Some times Dad gives me a "hit of the nip".  I do so like cat nip.  It makes me feel all relaxed 
                        and crazy at the same time.  I don't get it very often, but I sure do relish it.

                    <td>
                        I have little balls that are very fluffy.  They are stored in bags with cat nip.  I like to throw 
                        these around and run after and bat at them.  Sometimes, I even rip them apart with my teeth.  I 
                        even get pieces of the balls stuck in my mouth.  Dad sometimes has to help me getting that fuzziness 
                        off.
